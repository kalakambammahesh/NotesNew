Annotaions:
Annotations are used to provide supplement information about a program.

Annotations start with ‘@’.
Annotations do not change action of a compiled program.
Annotations help to associate metadata (information) to the program elements i.e. instance variables, constructors, methods, classes, etc.
Annotations are not pure comments as they can change the way a program is treated by compiler. See below code for example.

Three Types of Annotaions:
1. Marker Annotaions: Ex: @Override, @TestAnnotaion
2.Single value Annotaions: Ex @TestAnnotaion("testig");  testing is value
3.Full Annotations : @TestAnnotaions(owner = "Mahesh", value="K")

***Java defines seven built-in annotations.

Four are imported from java.lang.annotation: @Retention, @Documented, @Target, and @Inherited.
Three are included in java.lang: @Deprecated, @Override and @SuppressWarnings
