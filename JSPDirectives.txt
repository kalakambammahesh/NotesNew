The jsp directives are messages that tells the web container how to translate a JSP page into the corresponding servlet.

There are three types of directives:

page directive
include directive
taglib directive

Syntax: <%@ directive attribute="value">

1.JSP page directive :The page directive defines attributes that apply to an entire JSP page.
	<%@ page attribute="value">

	Attributes of JSP page Directive
	Attributes of JSP page directive
import
contentType
extends
info
buffer
language
isELIgnored
isThreadSafe
autoFlush
session
pageEncoding
errorPage
isErrorPage

2.JSP include Directive:
The include directive is used to include the contents of any resource it may be jsp file, html file or text file. 
The include directive includes the original content of the included resource at page translation time
 (the jsp page is translated only once so it will be better to include static resource).
***Advantage of Include directive :: Code Reusability
Syntax::: <%@ include file="resource name"%>

3.JSP taglib Directive:

Syntax:: <%@ taglib uri="uriOfTheTagLibrary" prefix="prefixOFTagLibrary" %>

Exception Handling in JSP:
1.By errorPage and isErrorPage attribures of page directive
2.By <error-page> element in web.xml
